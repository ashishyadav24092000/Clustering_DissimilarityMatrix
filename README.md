# Clustering_DissimilarityMatrix
In this repo i have tried to explain how to calculate Euclidean Distance,manhattan distance, and Finally Calculating the Dissimilarity Matrix/Distance Matrix using python.

# Important Libraries Used::
  1. Scipy.spatial for calculating the distance matrix and Euclidean,manhattan distance.
  2. Pandas for creating the dataframes.
  3. numpy for creating arrays/lists to store data.
# Euclidean formula
  the distance between two points (x1 , y1) and (x2 , y2) is d = √[(x2 – x1)^2 + (y2 – y1)^2]
# Manhattan Distance  
  The Manhattan Distance between two points (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) is given by d = |X1 – X2| + |Y1 – Y2|.
